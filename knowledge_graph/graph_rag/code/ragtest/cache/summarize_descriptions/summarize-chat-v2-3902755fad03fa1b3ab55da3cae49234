Despite facing personal loss, he experiences reconciliation and happiness, notably in his interactions with Mr. Scrooge's nephew, where he discusses his family's situation. His mention of Scrooge, calling him the Founder of the Feast, reflects his attempt to maintain the spirit of Christmas and his capacity to see the good in others, even when faced with grievances.\n\nHis employment under Mr. Scrooge is a significant aspect of his life, where he is portrayed as an employee who arrives late to work due to celebrating merrily the day before, apologizing for his tardiness.
