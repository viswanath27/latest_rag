{"result": "Marley is a character who is confirmed dead at the beginning of the story, a fact well-documented and undisputed with his burial register signed by multiple individuals, including Scrooge, his former partner. Marley's death serves as a crucial point for the story's premise, establishing him emphatically as deceased from the start. Despite being dead for seven years, Marley's memory and image dominate Scrooge's thoughts, indicating a significant relationship and shared experiences between the two. Marley's presence is anticipated by Scrooge, suggesting a profound impact on the latter's life.\n\nMarley is depicted with a ghostly appearance, characterized by a dismal light about him and ghostly spectacles, which underscores his supernatural presence. This spectral form of Marley is so vivid that he replaces the knocker on Scrooge's door with his face in a supernatural manifestation, further emphasizing the deep connection and the haunting influence he has over Scrooge.
