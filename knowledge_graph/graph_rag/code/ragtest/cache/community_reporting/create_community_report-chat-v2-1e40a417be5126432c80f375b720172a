Initially, Bob Cratchit's house serves as a significant location that both Scrooge and the Ghost visit, highlighting a direct but complicated connection between him and Scrooge. This visit, along with others, indicates Scrooge's reflections on Cratchit's family life and their intertwined lives. Early on, Bob Cratchit experiences relief when moving past mentions of Scrooge, suggesting a strained relationship affected negatively by Scrooge's harsh demeanor and the power dynamic inherent in their employer-employee relationship. This dynamic is further illustrated by Scrooge's anticipation of catching Bob Cratchit coming late to the office, a scenario that underscores the contentious nature of their interactions, particularly over issues such as taking a holiday for Christmas Eve.\n\nHowever, a significant shift occurs in their relationship, marked by Scrooge's decision to send a large turkey to Bob Cratchit's family as a surprise gift. This act of kindness is a clear indication of Scrooge's changing attitude towards Bob and his family. The change is further cemented when Scrooge promises to raise Bob Cratchit's salary and assist his struggling family, actions that signify a pivotal transformation in their relationship.

This shift in Scrooge's character is further exemplified by his decision to send a turkey to the Cratchit family that is twice the size of Tiny Tim, a gesture that underscores his concern and generosity towards them, especially Tiny Tim.
