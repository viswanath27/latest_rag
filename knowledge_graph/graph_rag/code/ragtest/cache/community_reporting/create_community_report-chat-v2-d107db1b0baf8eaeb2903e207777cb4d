This positive outlook is especially notable when he returns Christmas greetings with warmth, highlighting a significant difference from Scrooge's cold demeanor. Furthermore, the narrative suggests that Scrooge sees his clerk not just as an employee but possibly as a missed opportunity for kindness or a subject of regret, indicating a complex relationship between the two.

Despite this, there are moments indicating a potential for change in their relationship; Scrooge expresses a wish to say a word or two to his clerk, suggesting a moment of regret or a desire for reconciliation. However, Scrooge's disdain for Christmas is further emphasized when he overhears his clerk warmly returning Christmas greetings, an action that irritates Scrooge. The clerk's warm response to Christmas greetings contrasts sharply with Scrooge's cold demeanor, underscoring the differing values between them, particularly in their attitudes towards Christmas.

Scrooge is haunted not just by the memory of Marley but by Marley's ghost itself, which appears to him in a spectral form. This haunting is a testament to their deep, albeit unsettling, connection. The ghostly visitation, where Scrooge is confronted by Marley's apparition, highlights a personal history and a bond that transcends the physical world, suggesting a supernatural connection between them. This is further evidenced by Scrooge seeing Marley's face in place of his door knocker, a symbolic manifestation of Marley's lingering presence in Scrooge's life.\n\nMoreover, Scrooge's cautious behavior upon entering his house, possibly expecting or fearing Marley's presence, indicates the profound impact Marley's memory and possible supernatural visitations have on him.
