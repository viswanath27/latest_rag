Despite the challenges of working in a dismal little cell, where he copies letters and struggles to keep warm beside a fire so small it barely holds a coal, Scrooge's Clerk maintains a warm and merry disposition towards the holiday season. This positive outlook is especially notable when he returns Christmas greetings with warmth, highlighting a significant difference from Scrooge's cold demeanor. Furthermore, the narrative suggests that Scrooge sees his clerk not just as an employee but possibly as a missed opportunity for kindness or a subject of regret, indicating a complex relationship between the two.

Scrooge exercises control over his clerk, including limiting the clerk's access to coal for warmth, which underscores the lack of empathy Scrooge has towards his employee. This control highlights the significant power imbalance between them. Despite this, there are moments indicating a potential for change in their relationship; Scrooge expresses a wish to say a word or two to his clerk, suggesting a moment of regret or a desire for reconciliation. However, Scrooge's disdain for Christmas is further emphasized when he overhears his clerk warmly returning Christmas greetings, an action that irritates Scrooge. The clerk's warm response to Christmas greetings contrasts sharply with Scrooge's cold demeanor, underscoring the differing values between them, particularly in their attitudes towards Christmas.
